# Phylogenetics Tutorial
harmslab phylogenetics tutorial 

# To add:

- intro - why is this useful?

- setup - point users to basic tools/dependencies. 
  - python-for-scientists
    - pandas, numpy, scipy, etc.
  - phylogenetics 
  - phylopandas
  - phylovega
  - pyASR
  - biopython
  - any other necessary installs
  
  
- overview of approach to tree-building and ASR:
  - iterative: get seqs --> align --> build tree --> ancestors
  (make cool graphic of this)
  - what is your question, how that informs tree-building decisions
  
- blasting:
  - seed seqs
  - reverse blasting
  
- alignments:
  - tools
  - clustering
  - manual curation
  
 - tree building
 
 - ASR
